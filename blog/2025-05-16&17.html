          <p><strong><em>Denny - May 16 - Friday.  Take Two or Rinse & Repeat</em></strong></p>

<p>I got up early and trying to let Kevin sleep to get feeling  better,  I lay down on the couch.  Hmmmm…. What is that I’m hearing over in the stove?  It sounds like a …… yup – a mouse!</p>

<p>Out came the traps and – once again (fingers crossed) problem solved.   Tear apart the stove, wash, disinfect, and re-set traps just in case.  Ok – so our confidence has been shaken a little in our being totally mouse free.</p>

<p>Kevin is still under the weather, tries to make some contacts for people up ahead, visits the local historical society, and rests for a few minutes.  I work on my blogs and journal.   The weather is pleasant today and the camp spot we’re in is next to the ball diamond where the firefighters practice and a cattle auction lot is nearby so we listen to the auctioneer and enjoy the summer-time feel of baseball.</p>

<p>Since there is no biking to report, today may be a good day to bring up the subject of clothing.  As I was reading Keturah Belknap she was talking about how all her neighbors came to help her sew clothing and bedding for their trip to Oregon.  I imagine those were sweet hours spent with her friends before her departure.   Before we left home, I and my daughter Catherine were sewing quilts for my grandson’s graduation and it was a fun time to visit and spend time together. Catherine’s friend, SanDee and daughters joined us.</p>

              </figure> <p>  

            <p>Having to acquire clothing is the bane of my existence consequently I am SO grateful for the people and stores that have come into my life in terms of clothing us for this Trek!   I thank them every time I get dressed in the morning.</p>

<p> First, as I mentioned earlier, I’m grateful for the employee at Image Wear in Provo Utah who suggested we get the lightweight fabric for our t-shirts.   They have been absolutely marvelous!  Easy to dry, wrinkle-free, and so breathable – it’s a joy to wear.  And the hiking pants we got from Amazon have been the same – fabulous for what we are doing.   Add one dress for me and one suit for Kevin on Sundays and you get my kind of wardrobe planning. I can see why some people like school uniforms.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Denny - May 17 - Saturday.  Great Stories and Incredible Scenery</em></strong></p>

<p>158 car miles today – and each one of them bringing interesting stories and incredible scenery at every bend in the road.  Today was the day Kevin had set aside to research Colonel Kearney’s return route from his South Pass Expedition of 1845.    Kearney was headed south to Pueblo area then Bent’s Fort on his way back to Ft. Leavenworth. I can only tell you snippets of the history but I CAN tell you, anyone who drives it is in for real treat! (especially if you have Kevin along for your guide).</p>

<p>The past week we’ve been biking and camping in the “Goshen Hole” but today we started at Ft. Laramie and went northwest so we were approaching Goshen Hole from the back side of the bluffs we’d been looking at all week.  I’m not a geology geek, but the first time we crested the hill looking down at it I could see why the mountain men would winter in this valley sunken down and surrounded by big buttes.  It was so noticeably different than the terrain we’d been in. Since we had to go through Ft. Laramie again – I did get my sarsaparilla.  Deliscious!!!  And saw my third snake.  Fortunately it was on the dirt road and I was in the car.</p>

              </figure> <p>  
                

            <p>The first highlight of my day was seeing Bernard’s Fort and hearing Kevin share the story of John Baptist Reshaw (or Richard).  Standing there on the south side of the No. Platte River next to the excavation of his fort was impactful for me.   Knowing the many kindnesses, he’d done for the Mormon Pioneers made it very special.  Without him inviting the Mississippi Saints to winter in Pueblo, who knows what may have happened to all those women and children with the Battalion.  I was able to record Kevin so hopefully I can get it up on YouTube soon.</p>

<p> The second highlight was reaching a high pinnacle overlooking Goshen Hole.    We had traveled miles and miles on dirt roads to get to a spot close to the edge (my husband is a genius with a map!) We were finally rewarded with such a breathtaking view, both of us were overwhelmed. And not only grand views, but tiny beauties adorned our path which delighted us too.</p>

                </figcaption>
              </figure> <p>  
  
            <p>The flowers were so delicate but obviously so hearty to be able to survive in that harsh environment among all
              the cactus.  They are just like the pioneer women and women I know today --sharing their beauty wherever they are -- even if they find themselves in less than ideal circumstances.</p>
          
                
            <p>Standing there on that overlook reminded me of a time on our first trek just after we left Cow Springs, NM where we hiked to the top of a high overhang on the Continental Divide Trail, sat on the rocks and looked out over the valley.   There is something almost sacred when you find yourself in a place where you are so far removed from civilization that you feel like you are alone in the universe looking over God’s great creations. I will let Kevin share the most the photos but here is one of mine.</p>
