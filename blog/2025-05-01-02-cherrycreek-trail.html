          Denny – Point of Rocks to Denver,  CO  So  much to do – Not enough Time!<p>

            Putting up Kevin’s blogs (with my limited HTML skills-not to mention our handicapped hotspot issues) is quite a feat when you truly understand my minimal knowledge of how to make these posts go “live.”  If nothing else comes from this trek, I will have learned a few things about HTML and git-hub.  By doing this, our son Brian says I’m “brilliant.”  He is so proud I know what a repository is!<p>
            
            Seriously – we’ve biked A LOT of miles, seen even MORE gorgeous scenery, and had more than a few miracles the past few days.  I’m sure Kevin will highlight them in more detail but to catch you up on the woman’s perspective…it’s been a delight – even though living conditions have been somewhat challenging. <p>
            
            After giving Kevin a drink of our RV water, he decided it wasn’t fit to drink and with nowhere to get water, we have hobbled along using the ten gallons of fresh water we got at Pueblo State Park this past week.    It’s amazing how little water it takes to do dishes!  But once again our “Tiltin Hilton” seemed more like a hard sided tent with a soft bed.  I think we managed quite nicely considering we had no water or electricity.  Propane is a fabulous commodity.   I’m pleased to say we only turned the heater on for a few minutes one night.  We’re not suffering by any stretch, but we are having to be creative. <p>
            
            I cannot share everything I’ve written in my journal, but there are a few highlights I’d like to pass on.  I have a very different experience than my husband.   And speaking to that subject, I’d like to give a HUGE shout out for all he is doing.  It is a stressful adventure for his part, and he has A LOT to think about.  I have the easy life – feed him, pedal a bit, and enjoy the scenery and people we meet.  He has to worry about the logistics, miles, weather, presentations, events, and me.  He’s my hero!<p>
            
            
            <strong><em>May 1</em></strong>
            
            Point of Rocks and meeting with Cody was a definite high point for me.  What an impressive young man who is taking his stewardship over his property so seriously.   I hope all of you can feel that when you watch the video.   Absolutely stunning property – I for one am grateful he has it because I know he’ll take care of it.  And I’d like to pay respect to his Aunt Ruth and Uncle Bill who had the forethought to preserve it and did such a wonderful job of fostering the love of history and nature in their nephew.  It was fun to watch for Aunt Ruth’s birdhouses.<p>
            
            I also loved Cave Creek but I was leery of rattlesnakes since we found one in the restroom at Pueblo State Park.   We ate lunch on a rock there and just enjoyed the birds and beautiful view across the valley.    I could imagine people stopping there and using it as a protection from the elements.  The hills were once again evident and by the luck of the draw it seemed I was the one who got them.   And the wind.   The wind never stops.   For all you ladies who may be reading this, I’ll share I cake lotion on my face and have almost gone through a tube of Chapstick in one week.  It definitely makes me wonder what the women did to keep their skin from cracking and turning into leather.<p>
            
    

              <strong><em>May 2</em></strong>
              I was rescued by Angels in the Form of Cherry Creek State Park Workers.  I think the important lesson I learned today was “All Maps are not Equal”  I thought Kevin and I were using the same maps – and when I had pedaled over 15 miles and not found the car, my phone battery was at 4%, and I had no idea how to find the car, I was rescued by three young people who gave me a paper map, charged my phone, and helped me realize I’d made my way to  the wrong side of the lake!  The car was about four miles away.  All went well, and I DID find the car.  Poor Kevin was left stranded in downtown Denver at Confluence Park.  We did over 50 miles.  Thankfully – the 25+ miles I rode were (once again) beautiful.<p>
             
             
             I had a most interesting experience on the Cherry Creek Trail looking out into a field of grass.   It was a lesson to me of the value of Old and New.  
             When I first looked at the meadow, I thought there was a new type of flower I hadn’t seen before, but upon closer scrutiny I discovered it was a mix of new spring grass and old dried dead grass from last year.   It made me think of all the beauty we get in our lives from both the “old” (Historical things) and “new” (The people in our lives now.)    I know how much my life has been enriched lately with the research I’ve done to know my grandparents and also the new friends I’ve met already on this trek. Trust me – the picture doesn’t do it justice.<p>
